# svelte-template
Svelte template with sass, parcel and yarn

You can find some mixins in the utils folder at the sass section
_found pug a little confusing for me at first so will drop it by now_

Made this template based on what i use to create a new project with svelte, i really like using parcel, and i a giving svelte a try, you can use any scss or sass in your app.


## run yarn dev
For a fast parcel server with hot reloading 

or

## yarn build
For a production approach, all compiled files can be found in the public folder.
